title: Profiling JIT-ted code with OProfile

You can now profile JIT-ted code!

Before:

After:

In short, you can tell how Rubinius' JIT works.

Not satified yet? Even annotated profile is supported! That means you can even know how much it spends on each line of Ruby code or on each CPU instructions.

For this, we're using OProfile, a profiling software.

### What's OProfile?

It's a very useful profiling tool available on Linux. It's a sampling-based one. That means there is absolutely no change to running Rubinius and your Ruby code to profile. Just run it nor/afzumally you do. Also, profiling overhead is minimal.

This is constrasted to measuing-based profiling. Ruby's built-in profile belongs to it.

### Setup

Sadly, you have manually to build LLVM and OProfile even on dacent Linux distribution like Ubuntu because there is several bugs. In a say, we are really on the cutting edge. ;)

Build and Install OProfile

    # assume you're at the top directory of rubinius repository.
    $ sudo apt-get build-dep oprofile
    $ git clone git://oprofile.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/oprofile/oprofile vendor/oprofile
    $ cd vendor/oprofile
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure --prefix /usr
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ opreport --version
    # it says like this: opreport: oprofile 0.9.9git compiled on Mar  8 2013 00:57:08
    $ cd ../..

Force to build LLVM with OProfile support enabled and rebuild Rubinius

    $ ruby1.9.1 ./configure --llvm-force-build
    # configure prints that the header 'opagent.h' is found.)
    $ ruby1.9.1 -S rake

Run OProfile daemon (requires 

    $ sudo opcontrol --deinit
    $ echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
    $ sudo opcontrol --start

### How to read the profile result

### Further profiling

There is new proling tool on Linux: perf and operf (OProfile's new command). I don't know them well, but certainly they will be useful for profiling Rubinius.




It's now **[very easy](https://github.com/rubinius/heroku-rbx-puma-rails-app)** to get a [Rails app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails3) on [Heroku's Cedar Stack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar) running on [Rubinius 2.0](http://rubini.us "Rubinius : Use Ruby&#8482;") and [Puma 2.0](http://puma.io "A Modern, Concurrent Web Server for Ruby - Puma").


### The Backstory

The fine folks at Heroku have been adding support for using [Bundler](http://gembundler.com "Bundler: The best way to manage a Ruby application's gems") to [specify which version of Ruby](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby-versions) your app uses and even [to specify which Ruby](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2012/12/13/run_jruby_on_heroku_right_now) it uses.

I've checked in on the progress of using Rubinius with this same method every couple few months for the past year or so. I was always met with the same results... <q>"not quite yet, we're working on it"</q>.

Last night I was getting mentally packed for [Waza](https://waza.heroku.com/2013) later this week and decided to check in on the state of things so I could ask the right people the right questions in person when we're all together. Turns out that sometime between last time and this time, they've got things working. Boom diggity! And it's pretty ding-dang easy too! Double boom diggity!


### The Build Up

I'm going to assume that if you want to use Rubinius 2.0 that you also have the good sense to want to use Puma 2.0. There are three very simple steps to get up and running with Rubinius 2.0 + Puma 2.0.

#### Step 1

Add the Puma gem to your `Gemfile`.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/veganstraightedge/5041441.js"></script>


#### Step 2

Tell Heroku to use Puma as your web server in your `Procfile`.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/veganstraightedge/0135a61335bc76b1d9d5.js"></script>

#### Step 3

Specify Rubinius as your Ruby engine in your `Gemfile`.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/veganstraightedge/1fb7ff88e74567c6e2e6.js"></script>


### The Breakdown

Once you've done those things, your workflow is the same as before.
`bundle update && git commit -am "Double boom diggity!" && git push heroku master`

If you're changing an existing app from Heroku's default Ruby (MRI 1.9.x) to Rubinius, you'll see a message like this when you `git push heroku master`.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/veganstraightedge/5041986.js"></script>

The important lines are `Old: ruby 1.9.3` and `New: rubinius 2.0.0.rc1`. After that, everything the same as before. The bundling starts, etc.


### The Outro

That's it. You should now be up and running with Rubinius and Puma!

If you have problems, say something in the comments with a link to a gist with your problem output. If you succeed and get up and running in production, let us in the comments too. Tell the world that you love Rubinius/Puma.

I threw together this [quick and dirty Rails app](https://github.com/rubinius/heroku-rbx-puma-rails-app) from scratch deployed to Heroku to show all this in action. [http://heroku-rbx-puma-rails-app.herokuapp.com](http://heroku-rbx-puma-rails-app.herokuapp.com "Using Rubinius &amp; Puma on Heroku"). I also migrated an existing MRI 1.9.3 app ( [The Farmhouse site](http://farmhouse.la "The Farmhouse in Hollywood, California") ) to Rubinius 2.0 to show the migration is easy too.


### The Thank Yous

None of this would be possible without the hard work of [Carl Lerche](https://github.com/carllerche), [Yehuda Katz](https://github.com/wycats/), [Andr√© Arko](https://github.com/indirect/), [Terrence Lee](https://github.com/hone) and the other contributors to [Bundler](https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler). And a special thanks to Terrence Lee for his dutiful stewardship of the [Heroku Ruby Buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby/). Once again, the awesome powers of Open Source make great things possible.


### The Footnotes

As of this writing "Rubinius 2.0" actually means "Rubinius 2.0.0.dev" and "Puma 2.0" actually means "Puma 2.0.0b6". The net result is the same though.
